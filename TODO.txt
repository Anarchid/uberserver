should be fixed:
ingame time is broken

latest:
make everything configurable through DataHandler/_root and command-line options/config file

to fix/add:

multiple protocol support

don't cater to scunthorpe (match swear words on registration)
channel registering (set owner)
channel configuration (antispam)
reloading <-- needs fixed. see above
quietness? (whether to print sayhooks actions)
maybe send things to admins/owner
transfer of ownership
default user state for channels :D << allows "moderated" channels
locked channels hidden by default (hide, show, lock)
renames
working SQLite -- integrate SQLUsers.py and DataHandler.py << just force single thread
mods the power to check account registration dates, also needs registration date saved in db
loading and saving of channels from sql
fix ghosting, instead of ghosting, resend login data properly?
track disconnected clients since the last command they sent - resend all data from that point.

final todo: should be indistinguishable from tasserver to the untrained eye upon initial deployment

thoughts:
ability to host multiple battles simultaneously if you have a bot tag
move battle ingame notification from host's ingame status to an updatebattleinfo param

insane amounts of stats - maybe through a separate sql db and a bot

separate in-battle map sync and map download percentage
make a unit test for sql, run it through sqlite
