current:

before release:
make everything configurable through DataHandler/_root and command-line options/config file

port testing

SayHooks:
channel registering (set owner)
channel configuration (antispam)
reloading <-- needs fixed. see above
quietness? (whether to print sayhooks actions)
maybe send things to admins/owner
transfer of ownership
default user state for channels :D << allows "moderated" channels

add spam protecton for commands
don't update battles, clientstatus, etc unless something actually changed

embed fake chanserv in channels if !#chanserv on
renames
web interface (connect with loopback socket or w/e)

working reloading (just need to finish _erase)

working SQLite -- integrate SQLUsers.py and DataHandler.py

finish sayhooks

mods the power to check account registration dates, also needs registration date saved in db

loading and saving of channels from sql
access levels - webadmin, server (, ajax?)

auto-idle on 30 sec without communication
unless 10% are idle, or just don't send to idle people... only send status updates to people who aren't idle :D

make battles and channels into objects -- the dictionary method requires me to reference the dictionary every time I want to reliably read/write something... and it's not always clean

fix ghosting
instead of ghosting, resend login data properly?

todo:

"i didn't say hard to implement, just less likely to happend ;-)
and yes, i do see it's usefulness and i'd want the possibility too to set a maximum rank allowed
edit: (which doesn't implies autokicks nor no evidence outside the battle itself)"

satirik wants map grading << not important atm

ajax interface -- intermediate server? php?


figure out linked servers (later):
gzipped stream
need to negotiate every event...



completed, not verified:
do blind channels work?
server-side battle bans
ingame time resolve on drop from server
