should be fixed:
ingame time is broken

to fix:

don't cater to scunthorpe (match swear words on registration)

make everything configurable through DataHandler/_root and command-line options/config file
channel registering (set owner)
channel configuration (antispam)
reloading <-- needs fixed. see above
quietness? (whether to print sayhooks actions)
maybe send things to admins/owner
transfer of ownership
default user state for channels :D << allows "moderated" channels
locked channels hidden by default (hide, show, lock)
renames
working SQLite -- integrate SQLUsers.py and DataHandler.py << just force single thread
mods the power to check account registration dates, also needs registration date saved in db
loading and saving of channels from sql
fix ghosting, instead of ghosting, resend login data properly?

make a unit test for sql, run it through sqlite

final todo: should be indistinguishable from tasserver to the untrained eye upon initial deployment
