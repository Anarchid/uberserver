should be fixed:
ingame time is broken

latest:
make everything configurable through DataHandler/_root and command-line options/config file
reloading <-- needs fixed. see above
transfer of ownership
channel registering (set owner)
working SQLite -- integrate SQLUsers.py and DataHandler.py << just force single thread
mods the power to check account registration dates, also needs registration date saved in db

to fix/add:

go case-insensitive to do easier name checking

chanserv -- finish commands, make them all work and compliant with existing chanserv
don't cater to scunthorpe (match swear words on registration)
channel configuration (antispam)
quietness? (whether to print sayhooks actions)
maybe send things to admins/owner
default user state for channels :D << allows "moderated" channels
locked channels hidden by default (hide, show, lock)
renames
loading and saving of channels from sql
fix ghosting, instead of ghosting, resend login data properly?

final todo: should be indistinguishable from tasserver to the untrained eye upon initial deployment

thoughts:
multiple protocol support
track disconnected clients since the last command they sent - resend all data from that point.
ability to host multiple battles simultaneously if you have a bot tag
move battle ingame notification from host's ingame status to an updatebattleinfo param

insane amounts of stats - maybe through a separate sql db and a bot

separate in-battle map sync and map download percentage
make a unit test for sql, run it through sqlite
